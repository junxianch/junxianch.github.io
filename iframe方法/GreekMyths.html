    <div class="main">
      <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Zeus</span>  
        was everywhere ---- seen and unseen.
        He changed his shape as easily as he changed the weather.
        He moved the sun and the moon and put constellations in the sky.
        He protected everyone----gods and mortals alike.
        In anger Zeus hurled his thunderbolt to punish those who deserved it.
        But he was also wise and fair and generous with his praise.
        Zeus first married Metis, but he made Hera his queen.
        Zeus and Hera bickered constantly, for Zeus had many wives, ----
        Goddess, nymphs, and mortals ---- and had many children, too.
        Hera was jealous of them all.
      </p>
      <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Hera</span> was beautiful and headstrong. Zeus won her when he turned
        Himself into a cuckoo and he flew into her arms, sheltered from the rain.
        Their wedding was so happy, it lasted three hundred years.
        But things changed. Though Hera helped and advised Zeus
        And bore him children, jealousy darkened her days.
        She hated her husband’s adventures.   She schemed against his many wives
        And children and caused them to hide in fear.
        Once, in anger, Hera even dared to steal Zeus’s thunderbolt.   But his temper
        Was stronger.   He hung her up from the sky with anvils tied to her feet,
        And freed her only when she repented.</p>    
      
      <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Hephaestus</span> was born in bad luck. He was so weak and lame,
        Hera took one look at him out and dropped of Olympus.
        He fell for a day and was rescued by the sea goddess Thetis and her sisters.
        They took him to their underwater grotto, and there he lived in secret.
        Hephaestus’s body grew strong, though he could never walk.
        He became a master craftsman and made beautiful objects of gold in his smithy.
        Many he gave to the goddess as thanks for their kindness.
        Nine years later Hera saw Thetis wearing an exquisite brooch
        And demanded to know who had made it. When Hera heard it was Hephaestus,
        She regretted her actions, she called him back to Olympus, allowed him
        To marry Aphrodite,  and created and even bigger workshop for him.
        Hephaestus became the worker of the gods, he made them golden palaces,
        Chariots, weapons, and tools.  For himself he invented two golden maidens
        Who helped him move about.  His artistry was the pride of Olympus.</p>
            
      <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Aphrodite</span> had no parents. She rose out of the sea
        On a cushion of foam.    She was beautiful, love bloomed around her -----
        And sometimes jealousy.
        Despite Hera’s protests Zeus gave Aphrodite a throne on Olympus
        And made her Hephaestus’s wife.   But she wasn’t always true to her
        Homely husband, for Aphrodite wore a magic girdle that made love
        Flare up among the gods.   Even Ares was a victim of her beauty,
        Though he loved war more.</p>
      
        <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Eros</span> was wild and mischievous.   Some say he was born at the
        Beginning of the time.   Some say he was born of Aphrodite and Ares.
        Eros’s greatest delight was to zip around shooting arrows of desire
        Into innocent victims.    Instantly they fell in love, whether they
        Wanted to or not.   And no one could stop him, not even Zeus.</p>
        
        <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Ares</span> was a god not even a mother could like.
        He was a cruel, bad-tempered coward who loved war.
        The bloodier the battle, the better.    In defeat he was a bad loser.
        If he was wounded, he startled even the gods with his pitiful tears.
        Ares stirred up trouble wherever he went.   Except for Aphrodite,
        No one wanted him around.</p>
        
        <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Poseidon</span> was moody. His temper could be as violent
        As the seas he ruled. He shook his trident, and leaping waves
        Flooded the land. He struck the earth, and mountains erupted.
        Poseidon created the first house, from a rock, with one blow.
        He raced the waves and traveled to Olympus in his golden
        Horse-drawn chariot. Most of the time Poseidon lived in a golden
        Underwater palace with his queen, Amphitrite, a lovely sea goddess.
        They had three children together, though Poseidon had many more.
        Like Zeus, he could not resist goddesses, nymphs, or mortals.</p>
        
        <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Athena</span> had a most unusual birth. Zeus had been warned
        That if Metis bore a son, he would depose Zeus just as Zeus and Cronus
        Had deposed their own fathers. Though Zeus needed wise Metis’s advice,
        He took no chances. One day he lured Metis close with his sweet words----
        And swallowed her.
        Soon after, Zeus was hit by a horrible headache. He howled for help.
        Hephaestus fetched his ax and split open Zeus’s head. Out sprang Athena,
        Armed for action. Immediately she became her father’s favorite advisor.
        <p>Athena was a warrior who hated war. She admired courage and
          Fairness and sought peaceful ways to settle fight. She also invented
          Many things----the flute, the trumpet, farm tools, and the olive tree.
          She taught the arts of cooking, spinning, and weaving.
            Athena had no time to marriage.</p>

            <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Hermes</span> was born in ready for action. As his mother slept in in his cave,
            He slipped out his cradle and went looking for adventure.
            He saw a tortoise, killed it, and invented the lyre from its shell.
            As he taught himself to play the instrument, he spied his brother Apollo’s cows----
            And stole them. Cunningly he swept away their hoofprints, and Apollo
            Couldn’t find it anywhere. 
            When little Hemes confessed his trick, his brother was furious.
            But Hermes was shrewd. He knew Apollo loved music, and offered him the lyre
            For the cows. Apollo have him the cows and more, and left happily with the lyre.
            Zeus was amused by his clever son but scolded him too.
            Hermes promised to not to steal or lie again----not much, anyway-----if Zeus gave
            Him a throne on Olympus. Zeus couldn’t resist. Hermes could talk anyone
            Into anything.
            Hermes grew up to be Zeus’s personal messenger and helper.
            He traveled as fast as the wind on winged sandals. He guided souls of the dead 
            To Hades and brought good luck to travelers everywhere.</p>
            
            <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Artemis</span> was just minutes old when she helped with the birth
            Of her twin, Apollo. Jealous Hera had been chasing their mother, Leto,
            All over the world. Artemis found her a safe place to rest, carried there by
            The South wind.
            One day her proud father asked Artemis what presents she would like.
            Artemis knew exactly what she wanted. She asked for a bow and arrows
            Like Apollo’s, so they could hunt together. She asked for a band
            Of nymphs for companions. She asked to stay young forever and never
            To have to marry. Zeus granted all her wishes ---- and more.
            Artemis was determined and fought for what she wanted.
            Her arrows stung, and she could cause suffering.
            But she loved animals and children and protected them.</p>

            <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Apollo</span> grew up quickly, as gods do. When he was four days old,
He asked Hephaestus to make him a silver bow and arrows. Then off he went,
To kill the dreaded serpent Python, which Hera had sent to kill his mother.
Apollo was dangerous with his arrows. He punished the guilty -----
Sometimes with the help of Artemis, his twin sister. They were close friends,
And both were great archers.
Yet Apollo was thoughtful. He advised others that one should search
To know one’s self. He also believed one should not overdo anything.
He said: Pan Metron Ariston, which means ”everything in moderation.”
Apollo had a tender side to him, too. He healed the sick, cared for animals.
And brought delight with his music. No one played the lyre as well.
And no one sang as sweetly as Apollo.</p>

<p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Hades</span> was as grim and gloomy as the Underworld, where he lived. 
He was also rich, for all the treasures in the ground were his.
Hades rarely left his Kingdom of the Dead. When Hermes brought
Souls of the dead to him, he prodded the unwilling ones into shadows.
.
He saw none escaped. Cerberus, his three-headed dog, stood guard
At the locked gate.
But Hades lonely and wanted a wife. Zeus said he could have.
His daughter Persephone. But Zeus knew she would not want part
With her mother, Demeter, to live in Hades’s gloomy kingdom.
Nor let Demeter let her go. So Zeus told Hades to kidnap Persephone.
Hades rode up into the brilliant sunshine ---- and that is what he did.</p>

<p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Demeter</span> and <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Persephone</span> were always together.
  Gentle Demeter loved her daughter and took her wherever she went
  As she tended her grain fields.
  But one day their joy vanished. As Persephone was out with friends
  Picking flowers, she disappeared. No one saw what happened ----
  Not even Demeter. She did not see Hades charge up in his chariot and snatch
  The lovely Persephone. She did not see him take her down,
  Down to the dark Underworld, to make her his queen.
  She did not hear her scream and cry for her mother.
  Demeter searched the earth for Persephone. She grew haggard
  And neglected ger fields. At last she heard what had happened.
  Furious, she told Zeus that until Persephone was returned, she would cause
  A famine ---- and she did. Soon fields grew barren, crops and trees withered,
  Animals and people staved. Zeus saw that Demeter meant her words.
  He sent Hermes to fetch Persephone from Hades.
  But Persephone had been tricked into eating four pomegranate seeds ------
  The food of dead. That meant she could not leave Hades forever.
  For four bleak months a year ---- one for every seed ---- she had return
  To the Underworld as Hades’s queen. Then spring came, the land turned green,
  And flowers bloomed ----- for Demeter and Persephone were together again.</p>
  
  <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold;">Dionysus</span>’s mother was struck dead by lightning before he was born.
It was an accident caused by jealous Hera. Zeus rescued his unborn son
And sewed him up in his own thigh, and there he stayed until he was born.
Dionysus was hidden from Hera’s sight and was raised among nymphs
And wild animals. But eventually Hera found him and drove him mad.
Dionysus traveled the world over, teaching the art of wine making.
With him went a band of wild satyrs and maenads. They danced in a frenzy
And raised a rumpus wherever they went. Hera had driven them mad too.
Later Dionysus recovered and, despite Hera’s protests, was welcomed
Into Olympus. Kind Hestia have up her throne for him.
She was comfortable by the hearth.</p>
