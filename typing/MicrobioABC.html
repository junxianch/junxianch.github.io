    <div class="main">
      <h4>A is for amoeba.</h4>

      <p>All living things are made of cells. Amoebas are living organisms made of just one cell!</p>
      We are living organisms made of many cells.</p>

      <h4>B is for b-cell.</h4>

      <P>b-cells are made in our bones and help to fight infections.</P>

      <h4>c is for chloroplast.</h4>

      <p>Chloroplast are found in plant cells. They transform sunlight into energy for the cell.</p>

       <h4>D is for DNA.</h4>

      <P>DNA is like a blueprint for the cell; It provides instructions for how to build proteins.</p>

      <h4>E is for E.  coli.</h4>

      <P>e.   coli is a bacteria that can make us sick with diarrhea.</P>

      <h4>F is for flagella.</h4>

      <P>A flagella is like a tail for cells.</P>

      <h4>G is for Golgi.</h4>

      <P>The Golgi help and transport proteins within a cell.</P>

      <H4>H is for h.   pylori.</H4>

      <p>H.   pylori is a bacteria that can gives us a bad stomachache.</P>

      <h4>I is for influenza.</h4>

      <p>Influenza in the name of the virus that causes the flu.</p>

      <h4>J is for cell junction.</h4>

      <p>Cell junctions help cells stay together and communicate. It is like a bridge between two cells.</p>

      <h4>K is for natural killer cell.</h4>

      <p>Natural killer cells destroy cancer cells as well as cells infected with viruses.</p>

      <h4>L is for lysosome.</h4>

      <p>A lysosome is like the cell’s stomach.
        Lysosomes can even “vomit” waste out of the cell.</p>

      <h4>M is for mitochondria.</h4>

      <p>Mitochondria are parts of the cell that make energy.</p>

      N is for cell nucleus.

      The cell nucleus holds and
      Protects a cell’s DNA.

      O is for organelles.

      Specialized cell parts are called
      Organelles. For example, the 
      Nucleus and Golgi are organelles.

      P is for plasma membrane.

      The plasma membrane of a cell is like
      Its skin; in holds the cell together and
      Protects it from bacteria and viruses.

      Q is for q  fever

      Q  fever is a disease caused by this
      Bacteria, which can actually hide
      Inside some of our cells.

      R is for rods and cones.

      Light rods cones

      Rods and cones are special cell types in 
      The eye. They detect light and send
      A signal to the brain for us to see.

      S is for…
      Smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

      The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is an
      Organelle that manufactures many
      Compounds and makes poisonous
      Chemicals safer for the cell.

      T is for t-cell.

      t-cell help keep us safe by fighting bad 
      cells and viruses. T-cells are made in  
      the part of the body called the thymus.

      U is for unicellular.

      Unicellular means made of just one cell
      (like this paramecium), whereas multicellular
      Means made of two of more cells (like us).

      V is for virus

      Viruses are small microscopic 
      Structures that infect other cells.
      This virus illustrated infects bacteria.

      W is for cell wall.

      Plant cells and have an
      Extra layer of protection around
      Them called a cell wall.

      X is for 
      Xylem. 

        
      Xylems are found inside plants 
      And they help to move water 
      And nutrients around.

      Y is for yeast.

      Yeast is a type of unicellular animal cell.
      There are many different types of yeast.
      Some help our body, others hurt it.
      Still others we use in making bread!

      Z is for zooplankton.

      Zooplankton, such as these rotifers, are
      Tiny microscopic animals that live in water.
      Without these microscopic critters, marine
      Life in the oceans would not possible.

      Now you 
      Know your
